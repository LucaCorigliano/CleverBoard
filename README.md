# CleverBoard (Work in Progress)
Keyboard rebinder for Windows!

## What's this?
CleverBoard is a Windows utility that I wrote several years ago. It allows complete customization of the keyboard via rebinding keys and scripting. I've decided to rewrite it from scratch, so it'll be a while before a release.

## How does it work?
It uses Hotkeys. Yep. I know it sounds janky but it worked flawlessly for me for years.

## Why should I use it?
Well it's up to you. 
For example I'm Italian and we use a lot of accented letters like àèìòù, but for some weird reason in the Italian keyboard layout on windows there is no way to input them in uppercase, so I just remap CAPS LOCK + è to È for example.
